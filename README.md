- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rachel, also known as @designbyXperience
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in User Experience Testing & Design, Design Systems (Figma and Zeroheight FTW), CSS Frameworks, and other front end geeky stuff!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about JSON Design Tokens and eventually how to build a CSS Framework, I'll probably forget to update this so just imagine something cool if a long time has passed.
- ðŸ“« Email me at hello@designbyxperience.com if you want to get in touch, or follow me on twitter @designXperience
